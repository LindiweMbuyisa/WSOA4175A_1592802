		<h2 class="quote">"Designer for creativity. Artist for accessibility and Creator for change."</h2>


		<p class="paragraph">Figuring out your niche as a creative is a difficult and challenging task to do.
			Furthermore creating a space for people to experience your work and have their perceived ideas is a
			difficult task to do. The representation becomes subjective to the users who will be looking through the
			website. The aim was to create a website for my body of work, showing the different work and beyond. It is a
			showcase of my work but also other interests as a designer. I decided to include projects that were
			reflective of the work I want to do. In that same breath I wanted to show the process and how it comes into
			play in each project I have done this by detailing the project in-depth. This website is not only an
			experience of the work but a combination of who I am, and what I define as. </p>

		<h2 class="statement">The Beginning can be difficult</h2>
		<p class="paragraph">I most definitely think that creating a website is difficult especially when you donâ€™t know
			where to start. I almost get carried away and begin coding. But I wanted to acknowledge the design process
			and
			its importance when designing a website. It helps you have a clear idea and when going into the front end
			development, It makes it easier to code and tackle the development part of it. And so lets begin with the
			first thing I did which is finding inspiration. I often really try to get inspiration from mainly images and
			mediums outside of the website community. Looking at posters and image compositions really helps you design
			something that stands out and more you. The main thing was to look less website at how stunning are those
			award winning websites on
			CSS winner. Hence I used the inspiration and the personal branding project as the foundation for the
			website. </p>
		<p class="paragraph">I begin all my designs with sketches and this helps me get into the flow of designing and
			trying out different layouts on paper where I can erase and just sketch without having to make everything
			perfect. Below are some of the sketches of the different sketches of the webpages on the website. As you can
			see it is a rough sketches and not perfect. I was not looking to get the final design but try out a few
			ideas
		</p>

		<h2 class="statement">The best part of the design process</h2>
		<p class="paragraph">The next step was jumping into Adobe XD and playing with different layouts and pushing the
			ideas/sketches I had further. I Slowly start incorporating the colours and typography. The aim was to try
			out
			different layouts and structure of the content on the website. Below are the different layouts to show how
			the idea progressed and evolved from the sketches to the final designs. Before getting to the final design,
			I also
			tried to play around with the typography and how I laid out the content on the website, further the colour
			combinations. </p>
		<h2 class="statement">The final product</h2>
		<p class="paragraph">To explain the final design, I went with the big and bold typography taking up majority of
			the space on the website. With the interactions of the website, I wanted to use different interactions for
			links but also not
			taking away from ensuring that the user will not get confused by what which words are links and not. I used
			the comic boom shape as an overlay for the buttons. To ensure users are aware of the links; I have black
			outline with the hover creating depth by having it white if the background is a gradient. This is also
			applied to the outlines for the navigation of the website. This is to show in which part of the website the
			user is
			in. I have labelled in similar style. </p>
