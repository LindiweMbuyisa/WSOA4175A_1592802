			<p class="creative-paragraph">June 16 also known as Youth Day is a commemoration of the uprising that began in Soweto and spread across South Africa which profoundly
				changed the socio-political landscape in South Africa. The events were triggered by the policies of the
				apartheid government that resulted in the introduction of the Bantu Education Act in 1953. The rise of
				the black consciousness movement and the formation of the South African students organisation raised the
				political consciousness of many students. While others joined the wave of the anti-apartheid sentiment
				within the student community when the language of Afrikaans and English were made compulsory as a medium
				of instruction in schools in 1974 and this led to black students mobilizing against such policies and
				rules of which resulted in the death of innocent young black students at the hands of police officers. This project did push me out of my comfrot zone as I am still learning After Effects.
